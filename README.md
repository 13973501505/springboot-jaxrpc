# springboot-jaxrpc
Perform a JAX-RPC call from a Springboot microservice.

Yes, I know right :) But some of the external parties that we work with are still using JAX-RPC. We wanted to still be able to develop microservices but support JAX-RPC. Didn't find anything out of the box here and this sample calls JAX-RPC service from a Springboot  microservice.
